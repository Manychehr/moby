<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">Imagine a company having a valuation of $39B but having $0 in revenue? Imagine us being long that same company? Guess what - those are both real facts. So who is the ridiculous company in question?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #332f4f;">It is Lucid Motors. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">I</span><span style="color: #332f4f;"><span color="#332f4f">f you don't know about Lucid Motors, they are an electric vehicle manufacturer just like Tesla. Building and doing research for the last several years, Lucid is finally ready to step into the limelight and begin selling their cars. Their new car, the Lucid Air, is beautiful and has a best in class EPA rated range of&nbsp;520 miles. For the first time, there seems to be an actual electric&nbsp;only "competitor" to Tesla. Let's get into why we like them, what we think about the car and where we think their stock price will go. But beware, this pick is likely to go down before it goes back up. This was one of the harder calls we've ever had to make, and the details here are very important&nbsp;👇</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #332f4f;">Lucid Motors Prelude:</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">Let us start off by clarifying what we mean by competitor. Tesla did $31B in revenue last year, while Lucid did $0 - so we realize calling them a competitor is somewhat laughable. What we actually mean though, is that Lucid is the first real electric first car company to actually have technology that rivals Tesla in some capacity. While we estimate close to a trillion dollars in battery R&amp;D (research and development) costs over the next decade, Lucid's current battery technology already has further range than Tesla. What that means is that their cars can travel further distances on the same charge. Given ease of travel is one of the biggest complaints of electric cars, having superior battery tech is one of the biggest obstacles to get past in order to get consumer adoption. So when we say competitor, we really mean someone who can rival Tesla over the LONG TERM. Even with superior battery tech, Lucid is a far way aways from being a real threat to Tesla&nbsp;TODAY.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">And TODAY, we actually believe the company is significantly overvalued. Trading at over 12x EV/EBITDA, the stock is about as expensive as it gets. And yes while the expectations are high, they still haven't even sold anything yet! Therefore we expect some pullback and volatility over the coming weeks/months. It is only over the longer term that we believe in the stock.&nbsp;So what makes them viable over the long term?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #332f4f;"><strong>Lucid Motors Competitive Advantage:</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3jgSdeVgr8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"> </iframe></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">If you want the detailed version on why their technology is better and why they have a competitive advantage - check out the video above. If you want the summary, look no further.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">Their real advantage and viability stems from their technology. One of the core reasons their tech is so good is because the CEO of Lucid was one of the early principal engineers at Tesla!&nbsp;Therefore he is one of the best people suited to actually lead a solution like this. When looking at their core tech solutions, we see the biggest advances in battery tech, design, lighting &amp; powertrain. The solutions they have in place far exceed even that of Tesla. And the&nbsp;gaps in the market are not nearly addressed by the legacy OEMs. With billions of dollars in TAM up for grabs, with other OEMs not launching at scale until next year, Lucid has 12 months to make&nbsp;significant process. Factor in any greater than expected government and/or regulatory support and subsidies and this could be the rocket fuel needed for further launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">When comparing this tech against their financial expectations, we see that they're expecting to have $23B in sales by the end of 2026 and&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #332f4f;">$8B EBITA by end of 2025. Looking at companies like GM, they're currently doing $120B in revenue, so $23B in 4 years from now is aggressive, but not unheard of if they take market share. Trading near valuations of Ferrari today, with a much bigger revenue opportunity (due to manufacturing), valuation expansion is actually feasible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #332f4f;">Risks:</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">One thing we must&nbsp;note is that this pick does not come without risks. </span><span style="color: #fa4441;"><b>Lucid is an extremely speculative play and will likely experience a lot of volatility&nbsp;over the coming years. This stock therefore is only for investors who are able to stomach the ups &amp; downs associated with high risk/high reward picks like Lucid.&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">With that context here are the biggest risks we see for the company:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #332f4f;"><strong>Can they expand internationally?</strong> The global shift to EV's is beyond clear. All global car manufacturers are deploying billions of dollars into this market in order to sustain their place in the future of mobility. With all of that capital geared towards development and marketing, does Lucid have enough of a brand presence to expand internationally? While they're known in the US (somewhat), they're relatively unknown elsewhere. Given how "late" they are to the game, it may be a tough/expensive hurdle to overcome. We believe they'll be able to get past this, but it is an inherent risk to their business model. We see this as a long term risk.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #332f4f;"><strong>Is demand high enough for that expensive of a car?&nbsp;</strong>The cheapest Lucid car comes with a price tag of $80k&nbsp;while the most expensive is up to $200k. Tesla was able to start with a similar business model and work its way downward in price, but that came with years of effort and billions of dollars in funding. It is impossible to say how long it'll take for Lucid to do the same, so they'll have to sustain high levels of demand for their expensive car until that starts to materialize. The biggest risk here then is if their business model is sustainable given how low of the population can actually afford their cars. Similar to the above, we believe they can overcome this, but it is something we need to be aware of. This is a short term risk that will need to be solved for in the next year or two. While it'll take awhile to roll out a car like this, plans towards a cheaper model will keep the market happy till then.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #332f4f;"><b>Will their tech continue to be superior or will it become marginalized?&nbsp;</b>Right now their range is best in class, but with billions if not trillions of dollars into EV R&amp;D over the next decade, is this an edge they can maintain? This is going to be very hard over the longer term as Tesla and other manufacturers start catching up. This is the biggest risk we see to their business and we see the solution as a function of time. If they can sustain an advantage long enough to find a cheaper solution while also building a brand, this can be achievable even if the tech becomes commoditized. However, if Tesla and others catch up much sooner than people expect this could be game over for Lucid. This is something we're actively monitoring!</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><span style="color: #332f4f;">Wrap-up:</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">While we believe in Lucid this is a highly speculative pick. This was one of the harder decisions we've made in recent history! Looking at comparables in the market, relative to their valuation today, the upside for Lucid is clear and that is 100's of billions of dollars added in valuation - which translates to many multiples on their stock price (which is very tempting). But this reward comes with significant risk. For now we're comfortable with the risk and therefore are initiating another position into the stock over the long term <strong>(we're actually underweight on the short term)</strong>. We'll continue to monitor the situation and change course if need be. But for the interim we are assigning a realistic price target, given the current stock price today.</span></p>
