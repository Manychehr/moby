<h2><strong>Nasdaq Overview:</strong></h2>
<p>While you do not need to be a professional investor to be aware of the NASDAQ stock exchange, did you know that the parent company of the second-largest stock exchange in the world is more than just that? Not only does NASDAQ, Inc. boast 3 stock exchanges in the US and 7 in Europe; it has been making tech based moves into the more lucrative investment intelligence and market technology segments too! Does this make NASDAQ a potent money-making investment? Let&rsquo;s break it down:</p>

In fact, while 2020 was a rollercoaster for most businesses, NASDAQ enjoyed a surge in all the 4 business segments that it caters to: Market Services, Corporate Platform Services, Investment Intelligence, and Market Technology.

In fact, while 2020 was a rollercoaster for most businesses, NASDAQ enjoyed a surge in all the 4 business segments that it caters to: Market Services, Corporate Platform Services, Investment Intelligence, and Market Technology. Let&rsquo;s break the fundamentals down to understand the performance better:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapidly &nbsp;increasing &nbsp;Revenues &nbsp;and &nbsp;Net &nbsp;Income:</strong> Arguably, &nbsp;no &nbsp;other indicators of performance can be as suggestive as company revenues and the net income earned over the years.

<li><strong>Surging Earnings and Dividends per Share:</strong> The increased profitability can be clearly observed from the growing Diluted Earnings per Share (Diluted EPS) - $5.59 in 2020 as compared to $4.63 in 2019 and $2.73 in 2018. The Diluted EPS reflects the dollar profit earned for every current (and potentially issued) share. NASDAQ also paid $1.94 in dividends in 2020 and provides an average dividend yield of 1.11%. This is great - especially from a stock we&rsquo;re analyzing from the growth perspective!</li>
<li><strong>Changing Business Model:</strong> With 70% of their revenues (now non-transactional in nature) predicted to rise to 80% by 2025, we are looking at higher margins, greater growth prospects and broader markets to penetrate. The company is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that its organic growth is sustained, and has made a number of tech acquisitions to facilitate the same.

<h2><strong>Our Take: </strong></h2>
<p>Some critics have remarked that the growth generated by NASDAQ might not be sustainable as the economy cools down, which would translate to low upside potential; we, however, beg to disagree. On the contrary, the company has proved in the last two years that its business is far from stagnant, as it comes face to face with other information services giants. Not only does this stock look like a promising growth opportunity, but it has also shown a lot of stability and resilience historically.</p>
