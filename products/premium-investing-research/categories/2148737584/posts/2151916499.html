    <p><span style="color: #bacfe7;"><em>Published on July 30, 2021</em></span></p>
<div data-mobiledoc="'{&quot;version&quot;:&quot;0.3.2&quot;,&quot;atoms&quot;:[],&quot;cards&quot;:[[&quot;image&quot;,{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://www.moby.co/content/images/2021/07/Crypto-Pricing.jpg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1690,&quot;height&quot;:728}],[&quot;html&quot;,{&quot;html&quot;:&quot;&lt;!--" tradingview="" widget="" begin="" --="">

<p>Can you think of anything more trendy than crypto for most retail investors? Once it gets some momentum, a flywheel effect kicks in. More and more people start talking about it and the price shoots up like crazy. All of this usually materializes quite quickly. But historically, most of these price spikes often lead to large crashes. However over time the market cap of the industry has been trending upwards.</p>
<p>The funny thing about it is when the prices start sky rocketing you usually have two different types of investors. One type of investor is the one jumps on the ship swearing they'll hold until it hits the moon. The other sits back and promises to wait until the prices go back down before diving in.</p>
<p>Want to know what they both have in common? They both never get in at the bottom. The chart here shows that exact story playing out in real time.</p>
<img src="https://www.moby.co/content/images/2021/07/Crypto-Pricing.jpg" width="502" height="216" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
<p>Rewind to late 2017/early 2018 and we saw the first wave of hysteria. Prices spiked quickly and they fell even faster. The investors who got in at the top often sold as it crashed, thus losing money in the process. And the investors who said they'd wait to invest, ended up choosing not to, as the world was calling for the end of crypto.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? The same thing happened earlier this year as crypto caught another wave of hysteria and the same story played out again. Some investors waited and never got in and even more got burned. But fast forward to today and we're in a very interesting pattern. We've seen the prices crash from the peak around $60K, but are still hovering way above the 2018 highs - which are now sitting in the $30-$40K price range. So now that the history lesson is over, you probably want to know what to do next!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Current State of the Crypto Market:</strong></h2>
<p>So where are we currently in the cycle? Is another crash coming? Is it going to surge back? The unpopular truth is, <u><strong>NO ONE KNOWS</strong></u>! And when we mean no one, we truly mean no one. No one is able to say definitively in either direction what will happen in the near term - regardless of what they tell you. So what do you do then? We've said it once and we'll say it again, become long term investors. You may be wondering to yourself, "Why?"</p>
<blockquote>Well if you believed in bitcoin at $60K you should love it 2x the amount when it hits $30K and is 50% off of the recent high's.</blockquote>
<p>Long story short, the way we're looking at this market is we believe in it over the long term. Day-to-day it is impossible to say. You don't want to hear that but it is the truth. If you want to make short term trades, there is money to be made, but that isn't investing and we are investors only - hard stop. So we're buying and continuing to hold our favorite coins for the next several years as we have over the last several years.</p>
<p>If you've made it this far and you still believe in our long term view of the industry, here are our top 3 coins for this year and the years to come!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Top 3 Long-Term Crypto's:</h2>
<h3><strong>1) Ethereum (ETH) </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Though used interchangeably, Ethereum and Ether are two different terms. While Ethereum is the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem that has been spearheading smart contract mechanism and open source blockchain system, Ether (ETH) is its native currency. The world&rsquo;s most active blockchain, Ethereum allows developers to build and operate applications within its ecosystem, aiming at eliminating the traditional banking and non- banking financial systems.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>It has also popularized the use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for the secured ownership of property.</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This developing ecosystem makes the currency much more stable and much less speculative. In fact, unlike Dogecoin, whose ~30% tokens are held by a single wallet, the biggest holding of ETH is only 5%. Only 7 wallets hold 1% or more tokens. In other words, the supply of the tokens can&rsquo;t be disrupted by a single holder.</li>
<li>We, therefore, believe that if our subscribers want to surf on the Crypto tide, they should prefer a token that has a huge upside potential but also has a long-term application in the growing DeFi sector. ETH ticks all the boxes, making it a more sustainable bet as compared to its peers. Factor in the transition from proof of work to proof of stake and ether has real life applications being deployed daily worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>2) Binance Coin (BNB)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Binance Coin is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance Crypto Exchange. The Binance Exchange is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, facilitating millions of transactions every second. Similar to ETH in the case of Ethereum, BNB is the currency for payment of fees and other transactions on the platform.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Yes, there is some negative news on them as of publishing this, but we still believe in them over the long term.</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The stability of its parent and the assurance of efficient management by Binance is why we feel that BNB is in safe hands. Moreover, the supply of BNB is not only limited (the maximum supply was capped at 200 Million tokens), but it is also obligated to burn about 50% of the tokens with the passage of time, leading to shortage in supply of the tokens and ultimately price rise.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>3) SushiSwap (SUSHI)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes, you read this coin right - SushiSwap. The name may be a joke but the tech is not. SushiSwap is a DeFi (decentralized finance) platform with software running on Ethereum that seeks to incentivize a network of users to operate a platform where users can buy and sell crypto assets. Similar to platforms like Uniswap and Balancer, SushiSwap uses a collection of liquidity pools to achieve this goal.</li>
<li>Even though Sushi started with Uniswap&rsquo;s code base, SushiSwap has made significant changes to differentiate themselves from their rival. The largest difference was when they provided their users with both additional means of generating rewards but also a say in the future of the decentralized exchange. They also have venture funding and real support. This is a project that has serious legs for the future!</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Bonus: NFT's</h2>
<ul>
<li>While it has cooled down a bit as of recent, NFT's were the hot topic recently! If you haven't heard of this, NFTs are a non-fungible token (hence the term NFT) that is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files.</li>
<li>Did we lose you? Effectively a NFT is a way to digitally own some sort of product/collectable. Think of it as moving something, such as a baseball card, from the physical world to the digital world. Therefore you own the right to the digital asset instead of the physical one!</li>
</ul>
<p>While these investments come with A LOT OF RISK, they're still interesting to watch. Our favorite use cases so far are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>NBA Top Shot:</h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the first killer apps on the Ethereum blockchain, NBA Top Shot got popularity quickly as an online video collection platform of NBA highlights. It has cooled off with the rest of the industry recently, but has an actual following with crazy user growth. Investing in their cards on platform has gotten serious traction. Proceed with caution!</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Recur:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recur is designing and developing on-chain branded experiences allowing fans to buy, collect, and re-sell digital products and collectibles (NFTs). It will build branded NFT Fan Experiences for global brands and is set to launch later this year. Right now they are not investable by the general public but is something to monitor once they launch!</li>
</ul>
