<p>For those of you that do not know Seth Klarman and his fund, Baupost Group, go check it out. Now. In a nutshell, Seth is probably the most successful and influential investor of all time next to Warren Buffet.For those of you that do know it, then you know how legendary this team is. And that is why you need to know of not only what his fund is doing, but why they are doing it and what it means. And thankfully we&rsquo;re here to help you understand just that!</p>

<p><strong>Looking at the graph above, 2 obvious things stick out.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) PSTH is the fund&rsquo;s largest buy of the quarter</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) The fund put $1.5B in capital to work. But what does this mean and why is it important?</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dig a bit further into this. Looking at PSTH, we&rsquo;re immediately intrigued by the fact that this was their largest add of the quarter. PSTH, otherwise known as Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH), is a SPAC by Bill Ackman (another legendary investor) that raised over $4B to acquire a &ldquo;mature unicorn company&rdquo; per their S1 Report. This is significant, because it signals that not only are SPAC&rsquo;s (which we&rsquo;ve written about before) important and here to stay, but that this fund has so much conviction in this one in particular that they made it one of their largest holdings! While the company to be acquired is not yet known, this signals to us two things.</p>
<p><strong>1) This could mean another large mature tech IPO for late 2020/2021 (which shows how much the space has heated up).</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Whatever the acquisition to be, Baupost believes it will be massive and we are listening!</strong> While this in isolation, does not equal an automatic buy signal, it definitely is something worth looking further into. As current shareholders already, this increases the conviction in our thesis and we continue to use this data to stay overweight the name.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s address point #2, which is the net capital the fund put to work. What this means is the fund had a somewhat large position in cash and was waiting for an opportune moment to deploy it and buy market securities. We can interpret this as the fund seeing the market in Q3 as a key moment to invest. They would do this because they would feel that the market was ready to rapidly appreciate (which it did) and therefore they probably made a killing. What we can also infer, given how large of a position they added, was that this move was not short term in nature. By seeing this infusion of capital into the market, especially into names where there were little to no near term catalysts, we believe that Baupost Group not only was bullish on Q3 but was also bullish on Q4!

But until then we are still watching cautiously to see if things may take a turn for the worst!</p>
<p>While the two points above are very important and help us get some additional insight it is always important to note that these reports need to be taken with a grain of salt. Why?
