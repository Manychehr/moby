<h2><strong>Do the recent changes in the investments of Bridgewater Associates indicate a changing economy?</strong></h2>
<p>The US has been the pioneer in hedge fund investments since the inception of this variant of funds, with the Assets Under Management (AUM) of the US hedge funds collectively crossing $3.8 Trillion (Q4 2020). Bridgewater Associates has long been at the pinnacle of this asset-rich Hedge Funds family. The Connecticut-based company, founded in 1975 by Ray Dalio (a HBS alumni, who is regarded as one of the greatest innovators in the Finance world, having pioneered the risk-parity investment approach), has consistently held a top spot in the list of the world&rsquo;s largest hedge fund firms. The firm offers three hedge funds to select from &ndash; Pure Alpha, All-Weather, and Pure Alpha Major Markets.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Approach:</strong></h2>
<p>The firm has historically adopted and excelled at the Global Macro approach to investment, which is based on the interpretation and anticipation of large-scale (macro) events and subsequent investment decisions. This strategy involves forecasts and analyses of interest rate trends, political atmosphere, government policies, international trade and payments, etc. According to Bloomberg, &ldquo;Bridgewater uses an investing system that combines traditional diversification with "wager[s] on or against markets around the world" and attempts to invest in instruments and markets that do not "move in lockstep" with each other.&rdquo; The strategy, therefore, is less aggressive than those of the firm&rsquo;s counterparts. In spite of that, its performance since the last few decades has consistently been better than the benchmarks, making Ray Dalio the most successful hedge manager of all time.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Statistics:</strong></h2>
<p>Boasting $223 Billion worth of Assets Under Management (AUM) and 105 institutional clients, the firm has consolidated its position at the top of the world&rsquo;s largest hedge fund firms after a very depressing performance in 2020 (it lost $12.1 Billion of client wealth). As per the data for April 2021, the firm posted 4% YTD returns on its flagship Pure Alpha (18%) macro strategy and 3.5% YTD on the less risky Pure Alpha (12%) strategy. Its Beta strategy, All-Weather, was up 4.38% YTD. Bridgewater has been the most successful hedge fund firm historically, having added more than $46.5 billion to client wealth since its inception, posting an average annual return north of 11% (vs 7% of S&amp;P500).</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Observations:</strong></h2>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission requires institutional investment managers with control of over $100 Million in assets, to file a quarterly report &ndash; Form 13F. The report gives a positional disclosure of relevant US holdings. (However, it must be noted that only LONG positions are disclosed, while the SHORT positions are neither disclosed nor netted off). We can use this report to see which positions and strategies they're going long on to understand where they see the most opportunity going forward. While we need to take this report with a grain of salt it is extremely helpful as we project forward our stock picks. Looking at this form for the largest hedge fund in the world shows us some interesting trends.</p>
<p>The firm has been drastically reducing its holdings in the Emerging Markets ETFs (for instance, its holdings in Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund has reduced to 11 Million units from almost 25 Million units at the end of 2019) and Gold ETFs (for example, ~1.7 Million units of SPDR Gold Trust vs ~4 Million in December 2019). Apparently, it has been trading in S&amp;P 500 Index Funds as per the need of the hour. However, what catches our eye on the analysis of the Q1 2021 report is the surging investment in the consumer sector giants, especially the ones belonging to the food and retail industries. The firm has heavily favored the likes of Coca Cola Co. (shareholding increased by 25%), PepsiCo, Inc. (21%), McDonald&rsquo;s Corp (22%), Starbucks Corp (17%) and Mondelez Int&rsquo;l Inc (25%), as well as Walmart, Inc. (17%), Costco Wholesale Corp (16%) and Target Corp (6%).</p>
<p>While the above sectors witnessed a lot of interest from Bridgewater, the Communications sector has fallen out of its favor. The shareholding of Chinese communications giant Baidu reduced by 28% during the quarter, accompanied by NetEase, Inc. (75%) among others.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2>
<p>As the Hedge Funds continue their quest of earning higher returns than the market for their clients, we believe that analyzing their activities can provide us with valuable inputs for our own investments. It seems that Bridgewater is expecting the consumer sector, especially the retail and food &amp; beverages industries to complete a rebound from their pandemic lows. Moreover, it seems to have an optimistic outlook of the developed economies for the near future, as shown by the movements in its ETF holdings. While these anticipations do seem reasonable, we recommend our readers to accept the same with a pinch of salt. While these established giants (and the growing companies in the same industry) do look like profitable investments, we recommend continuing to maintain an all-around, well-diversified portfolio to minimize unsystematic risks. As we said above, we need to take this with a grain of salt since we cannot see short positions, but overall this report is extremely helpful in helping us identify trends as they unfold. The transition from risky assets to less risky assets is apparent here and is something we've been calling out now for the last quarter. The structural change taking place across equities is clear and while tech could rebound investors are clearly signaling they care more about valuations now more than over the last few years.</p>
