<p><span style="color: #bacfe7;"><em>Published on December 18, 2020</em></span></p>
<h2><strong>Headline:</strong></h2>
<p>Every quarter hedge funds and institutional investors file a document called a form 13F. A form 13F is required to be filed by all institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management. It discloses their equity holdings and can provide some insights into what the "smart money" is doing in the market. &nbsp;This is a form many investors watch closely to see what the whales are doing!</p>
<h2><strong>Background (The Boring Part):</strong></h2>
<p>Congress created this filing requirement in 1975. Its intention was to provide the U.S. public with a view of the holdings of the nation's largest institutional investors. Lawmakers believed this would increase investor confidence in the integrity of the nation's financial markets. Firms that are considered institutional investment managers include mutual funds, hedge funds, trust companies, pension funds, insurance companies, and registered investment advisors.</p>
<p>Because 13F filings provide investors with a look at the holdings of Wall Street's top stock pickers, many smaller investors have sought to use the filings as a guide for their own investment strategies. Their rationale is that the nation's largest institutional investors are not only presumably the smartest, but their size also gives them the power to move markets.</p>
<h2><strong>How to use it:</strong></h2>
<p>So while we often look at specific funds to see what they're doing, we also sometimes like to take a step back and see what the broader industry is doing! Therefore the below picture was created, which shows all the top stocks bought/held across all 13F filers!</p>
<img src="https://kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/kajabi-storefronts-production/site/159870/products/HvKdwOsmTpSKQ0Gc96tj_Screen_Shot_2021-01-12_at_9.50.02_PM.png" width="499" height="247" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Key Insights:</strong></h2>
<p>So, what does this graph show us?</p>
<p><strong>1) Peloton (PTON), Zillow (Z), Chegg (CHGG), Nvidia (NVDA) &amp; Alibaba (BABA) were the top 5 stocks bought or held last quarter.</strong> At first glance we're very happy to see this. First and foremost it is because we recommended 4 out of the 5 stocks above, which institutions (aka the smart money) clearly agreed with!</p>
<p>While Chegg has trailed a bit in terms of performance earlier this year, we've seen a large come back in the latter half of the quarter, which could have been driven by these large funds. Additionally, we still think there is a lot of room to run for Chegg!</p>
<p><strong>2) While not every stock on this list has done well this last quarter, most of the above have performed better than the market averages.</strong> What we can take away from this is that, large institutional investors, helped move the market last quarter - which isn't always the case! Why we think this is, is because the market is predicated on supply and demand. When investors demand something the price goes up. However, when retail investors with small amounts of investment demand a stock, it doesn't usually move the needle because their overall demand is so small relative to total demand. However, when larger investors step in, the power of their purchases, move the entire market for demand. Think of it like this, if a stock's worth is $100B and someone buys $1 worth of stock, it essentially has 0 effect on how much of the stock is traded. However, if someone comes in and buys $1B worth of the stock, that will then have massive demand implications on the stock, which will shift the price! Long story short, what we saw last quarter was the "smart money" moving the market. The biggest takeaway from this, is that we should be trying to anticipate their moves, so that we can realize their gains too! By looking at the trends quarter to quarter and listening to their press releases, we can often trade with the "smart money" and predict their trades!</p>
<p><strong>3) Our third, final and potentially most important insight from this chart (although an unlimited number of insights could be drawn) is that technology investments have been DOMINATING other investments for a long time now.</strong> While the last decade can be categorized by a growth investment decade, the decade prior was more closely characterized as a value based decade. What that means is that investors (two decades ago) were more focused on fundamentals and finding stocks that were trading at discounts relative to their actual worth (think the Warren Buffett style of investing). Whereas the last decade, being growth focused, was less so about what a company was worth today and more so about what they may be worth in the future! Therefore that is why you have seen companies trading at crazy multiples relative to their earnings today, because investors believe they will be massive winners later down the road.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Because we've seen this shift in market dynamics before. While growth is on the forefront of everyone's mind today and it could be for some time to come, <strong>eventually value investing will be the better performer again!</strong> When we think of value investments we think of stocks that don't rapidly appreciate in price but rather provide stable dividends and slow predictable stock gains. These stocks, although sleepy, come with way less risk. If there is a shift in dynamics towards value investments, this could be a massive area to explore! What this would mean is that investors can buy stocks below their actual value, realize significant gains (if this style comes back to popularity), and see steady income. Should this shift come, this will be a massive change in dynamics and wealth creation from what we've seen the last 10 years. Only time will tell what will actually happen, but that is why diversifying your portfolio can be so powerful!</p>
