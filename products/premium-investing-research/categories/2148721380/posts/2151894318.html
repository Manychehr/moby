We believe this gives CGC best in class balance between Canada, where the cannabis market is more mature, and the US, where the cannabis market is in its infancy. Also, household name Constellation Brands, the global spirits producer, made a strategic $5B investment in the company in 2018. Constellation owns 37% stake in Canopy, which should help CGC to weather any liquidity issues, as CGC is incentivized to invest in Canopy&rsquo;s business. This also offers a compelling long term opportunity for cannabis infused drinks, as Constellation owns some of the largest alcoholic beverage brands in the world, including Corona, Modelo and Svedka.&quot;]]],[1,&quot;p&quot;,[[0,[0],1,&quot;Conclusion:&quot;]]],[1,&quot;p&quot;,[[0,[],0,&quot;Overall, we see CGC as being a long-term beneficiary of a world where cannabis becomes increasingly legalized.

<p>There are a few additional key drivers for CGC&rsquo;s growth which our analysts view as additional growth levers for the stock. For one, Canopy has also done a great job of strategically growing through M&amp;A, particularly in its 2019 acquisition of Acreage Holdings, a U.S. cannabis company. We believe this gives CGC best in class balance between Canada, where the cannabis market is more mature, and the US, where the cannabis market is in its infancy. Also, household name Constellation Brands, the global spirits producer, made a strategic $5B investment in the company in 2018. Constellation owns 37% stake in Canopy, which should help CGC to weather any liquidity issues, as CGC is incentivized to invest in Canopy&rsquo;s business. This also offers a compelling long term opportunity for cannabis infused drinks, as Constellation owns some of the largest alcoholic beverage brands in the world, including Corona, Modelo and Svedka.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2>
<p>Overall, we see CGC as being a long-term beneficiary of a world where cannabis becomes increasingly legalized. We like taking a best in class approach when the TAM opportunity is this big, and are initiating an overweight rating with a $39 price target, and 1 year time horizon.</p>
