This funding is designed to be a centralized pool of funds for federal agencies to pull from in order to bring their technology offerings into the 21st century.

Government agencies only have select contracts, or procurement vehicles that they can purchase products or services from for legal reasons. Oftentimes, to streamline contracting events, the federal government will assign certain companies as approved resellers on certain government contracts which act as the vehicle that agencies can use to purchase goods and services. Reselling tends to be a very high margin business, because the costs of administering the contractual paperwork is very slim, and they tend to charge a high fee, usually ~5%, for performing this service. Given the size of these government contracts (sometimes, 9-10 figure deals), 5% mark-up fees become extremely profitable and meaningful for CDW" s="" bottom="" line="">

Government agencies only have select contracts, or procurement vehicles that they can purchase products or services from for legal reasons. Oftentimes, to streamline contracting events, the federal government will assign certain companies as approved resellers on certain government contracts which act as the vehicle that agencies can use to purchase goods and services. Reselling tends to be a very high margin business, because the costs of administering the contractual paperwork is very slim, and they tend to charge a high fee, usually ~5%, for performing this service. Given the size of these government contracts (sometimes, 9-10 figure deals), 5% mark-up fees become extremely profitable and meaningful for CDW's bottom line.</p>
