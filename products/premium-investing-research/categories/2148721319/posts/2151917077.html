<p><span style="color: #bacfe7;"><em>Published on August 4, 2021</em></span></p>
<p>9 years ago the world was introduced to the concept of, "Hyperloop". Elon Musk made headlines when he released the concept for a "fifth form of transportation". This new transportation would could move passengers underground in low pressure pods at 100's of mph to 1000 mph. This would enable getting passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco in as little as 30 minutes without ever having to deal with traffic! Fast forward to today and that announcement set off the rest of the world on a wild goose chase to make this dream a reality.</p>
<blockquote><strong><span style="color: #06cbf8;">However what Elon and no one else realized at the time, was that this mode of transportation had the power to not only transform travel, but also had the ability to transform the world and how people interact with each other.</span></strong></blockquote>
<p>This is, because for the first time, multiple cities and rural areas can become connected more than ever! How? Here's an example: How many people commute from LA to SF every day? Probably under 1% as it is over a 5 hour drive. How many people commute from Paris to London every day? Also not very many as the train is close to 3 hours. But now with Hyperloop you would have the ability to live in significantly further places and commute quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Pair that with rising popularity of remote work and the need to live near where you work, continues to diminish. With people already leaving cities, and now connecting them on a faster global grid than cars, the face of the earth is set to change. While it is going to take awhile to get there, the possibility for connected cities &amp; areas is within our reach.</p>
<p>And with all this opportunity up for grabs, you better believe multiple companies are fighting to win the contracts for these massive projects. While a lot of them are private young startups, there are still a ton of public companies ripe for investment. And while it will also not be a winner take all market, the companies involved in paving the future of transportation for the world, have some serious upside coming their way.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>So, who are they? Let's break it down below:</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #332f4f;"><em>An example of what a Hyperloop Station could look like</em></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Before jumping into the companies aiming to change the face of the world. Let's give some context into the current scope of the project and where it stands. If you just want to see who the companies are, please feel free to skip this section.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>How The Hyperloop Works:</strong></h2>
<p>The proposed idea is to set the tubes to a near vacuum like environment. In this environment a Hyperloop pod is suspended and propelled forward. There is little to no friction and this gives the pods the ability to move at ridiculously high speeds extremely efficiently.</p>
<p><em>Despite how futuristic this tech seems to be, this has actually been around since the early 1900's. In fact the New York City underground public transit system attempted to do this then, but ultimately turned down the project.</em></p>
<p>However, for this to work the project will need to be built by a dozen companies. Elon Musk's Boring Company is one of them and they're focused on making the tunnels and infrastructure rather than actually building the pods people will move in. The pod focused company, Virgin Hyperloop (formerly known as Hyperloop One before Richard Branson made a large investment) is focused on the actual front end user experience. Then there are a dozen other companies focused on all of the moving pieces within the finished system (more on this below) as well.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Current Scope of Hyperloop:</h2>
<p>The real key though on how this "works", from a consumer perspective, is when it scales and the network effects start to multiply. Sure, connecting Los Angeles to San Fransisco is great, but connecting the rest of the country is where things start to really get interesting. While it seems farfetched, the goal is to have this ready sooner rather than decades from now. So where are we in the cycle?</p>
<p>We've gotten to the point where we people have already built functional systems and can really start to estimate time and costs. And the cost is going to be massive! The estimated cost is roughly $60M per kilometer of track.</p>
<blockquote><strong><span style="color: #06cbf8;">Extrapolating this further, we see that the cost to connect San Fransisco and Los Angeles would amount to roughly $10B!</span></strong></blockquote>
<p>This number also doesn't factor in ongoing costs and any incremental tech/safety builds. While this number may not scare some, keep in mind this is just two cities, connecting the US and the rest of the world could be in the trillions of dollars! While it may seem unrealistic for this to happen, the funny thing is, it already is.</p>
<p><strong>The takeaway here is that there will be, at the minimum, billions of dollars put to work. Therefore, as investors, we need to be aware of who which companies will be receiving this game changing investment.</strong></p>
<p>So who will be receiving the bulk of it? The answer lies in the construction companies and land companies.</p>

<p>The graphic above shows the initial estimated costs that Elon thought connecting SF &amp; LA would cost. While he ended up being $4B off, what he was right on was the prime drivers of cost. Therefore as long term investors, we're looking towards the companies seeing the bulk of spend.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Therefore here are our top companies who will benefit the most from Hyperloop:</h2>
<p>Please keep in mind that this investment will take YEARS to play out. But it often is the investments everyone ignores, that slowly appreciates and makes us rich! The key mark for these stocks will most likely take 3-5 years to play out as the industry will undergo a lot of pivotal changes by then:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Steel Corp (X): </strong>This is a stock that we actually recommend last October of 2020 when it was trading near $9.75</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fast forward to today and the stock is up over 160%! </strong>So why is it now recommended for Hyperloop? Largely because the need for steel is monumental for this project. As one of the core materials into the system, US Steel Corp stands to make serious revenue from this project alone. We estimate this stock to keep going on its path upward as the need for Steel continues to increase!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nucor (NUE): </strong>Nucor is the largest steel producer in the United States! If anyone is going to have a hand in building out this next great project, you better believe Nucor will be involved in some capacity. This stock stands to benefit greatly over the long term</li>
<li><strong>Cemex (CX): </strong>Cemex is a Mexican multinational building materials company that focuses on cement production and distribution. As another core material into the Hyperloop project, companies like Cemex stand to benefit as the demand for their product can increase significantly.</li>
<li><strong>Texas Pacific Land Trust (TPL): </strong>Look familiar? TPL was our number one stock pick earlier this year. With the stock up over 734% in the last 5 years, TPL is sure on a roll.</li>
</ul>
<p>But take a look at the above, what's the second biggest category of spend? Permits &amp; Land. Guess who is the largest private land owner in Texas? TPL. Add this to the long list of positive catalysts coming their way and TPL is a clear beneficiary of increased revenue to come over the next decade. But they're not the only winner here, we recommend finding the largest landowners in densely populated areas to find out who has a chance at pulling in serious revenue.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>How else it changes the world:</h2>
<p>So while connecting the country and finding investments is great, there are also a lot of other downstream benefits (think ESG investing) that will help change the world for the better. As the system relies mostly on renewable energy, the positive changes to our environment are endless! We have a real ability to drastically reduce our carbon footprint. By taking cars off of the road, reducing the number of flights and relying on a more sustainable power grid, Hyperloop can not only connect us but truly make the world less polluted!</p>
