    <h1 class="post-body-title">Why China May Beat Tesla at Its Own EV Game</h1>
    <p><span style="color: #bacfe7;"><em>Published on October 14, 2021</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">Experts are calling for China to overtake the US as the world's largest economy by the year 2030. Their rise in power over the last 40 years from poverty to somewhat of a comfortable middle class life has been astonishing. Even though Beijing and the central government still have full control over everything that goes on within their borders, the meteoric rise in wealth is unprecedented.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #06cbf8;">And now China is establishing the future of their economy in a new way via Electric Cars.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">While this may come as a surprise to some, China is actually a green energy powerhouse. They produce more solar panels, wind turbines and lithium ion batteries than any other country in the world. By 2030, it is estimated that they'll control most of the clean energy jobs and wealth and that is why we're predicting that they'll be at the center of EV's going forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">While China is extremely polluted, their incentive to get into green energy is purely opportunity based and the money is right before their eyes. Right now they are the largest market by EV's by sales in the world. 5% of sales there are EV's and 40% should be there by 2030. While they were late to the game on combustion based engines, they are surely not letting this opportunity pass them by. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;"><strong>The reason they've been able to capitalize on this opportunity is due to the 863 initiative that kicked off in 2001.</strong> They invested&nbsp;$130M in fuel cell, EV and hybrid development. This investment has since guided their clean energy development over the last 15 years. They want to be the world leader in EV's in order to further supplant the US and become the world's largest economic player.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">But since historically the car market has not done well international within China's borders, many of the American consumers and investors do not know who the biggest companies of tomorrow will be. Pair that with some serious governmental pressures, and not only do you need to project the right companies who will do well but you need to have a good sense of the geo-political climate and which companies have good relationships with the government. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #332f4f;">Therefore we created the list below to find the perfect cross section between the two!</span></strong></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #06cbf8;">So with that long intro, here are 3 companies who have a chance to see some serious upside in the EV sector!</span></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #332f4f;">1) Geely (GELYF):</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">Geely is an OTC stock that is huge in China! They bought Volvo from Ford and have a stake in Daimler. While they aren't selling as many cars as Tesla, they are rapidly testing new technologies. They also want to build 20,000 charging points and battery swaps stations across china.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">When looking at their current reach, we see they have cars that they sell for only $5,000 and are only 15 feet long. The benefits of this are obvious. With such small cars they are not only affordable but can be used anywhere within an urban setting.&nbsp;<strong>85% of miles driven in china is done locally as&nbsp;people don't travel far. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">With less distance, range becomes less important - thereby satisfying the needs of Chinese consumers becomes quite easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">And the government is helping them like crazy! They are incentivizing users to buy them by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #332f4f;"><strong>They created lanes in many Chinese cities where EV's can go and combustion engines cannot.&nbsp;</strong>Because traffic is such a problem in China, having this special ability makes a huge difference for many Chinese consumers.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #332f4f;"><strong>EV buyers get subsidies for buying these cars.&nbsp;</strong>Further pushing them to make the change.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #332f4f;"><strong>Getting parking permits for combustion engines is very hard.</strong> Whereas getting it for EV's is easy and with such small cars you can split a space for half the cost!</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #332f4f;"><strong>The government helped create 1.68M charging points relative to the 72,000 in the US.</strong> Therefore adoption becomes much easier!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">This all adds up to an unreal experience! Add in the fact that Geely has an amazing relationship with China (something that is paramount for being successful) and we see them achieving huge feats over the next decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">This is a long term play and will likely take some time to play out but is an amazing way to play the Chinese EV market!</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #332f4f;">2) Xpeng (XPEV):</span></strong></h3>

</strong></div>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">China&rsquo;s government has taken actions throughout this last year that convey pretty bluntly that they are not concerned with the stock performance of their companies. Just this year Didi, China&rsquo;s primary ride hailing service, was expected to be one of the largest IPOs of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">This IPO was then very publicly imploded by CAC, The Cyberspace Administration of China, who banned Didi for &ldquo;seriously violating laws&rdquo; about data collection and usage days after the company went public in the United States. They then went further by banning 25 of the company&rsquo;s other apps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #332f4f;">So, what can you do about this?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">Well for starters, understanding the government sentiment towards their companies is as, if not more important than understanding investor sentiment towards the company. China has set a standard that all companies must be willing to play by their rules without any room for negotiation or discussion, and this goes for everyone. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">We can remember back when Jack Ma went missing for months after being critical of Chinese Leadership. Our analysis is that many Chinese stocks are undervalued, but the most important thing to pay attention to is which ones are slipping under the radar of the Chinese government watchdogs and have strong sustained growth. <strong>Enter in Xpeng.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">A stock we've written about before, Xpeng is going to be a giant in the electric car industry for years to come.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">T</span><span style="color: #332f4f;">hey have a top 15 selling car in China and are still relatively young. One thing to note with them however is that they are a very high risk high reward play. This is another pick to hold onto for years but will come with significant volatility.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">MP is the largest American rare-earth materials mining company who provides the world with a sustainable, low-cost supply chain of coveted materials that help power the modern economy. This investment is not only an ESG (socially responsible) investment but an investment into electrification of vehicles, planes, trains, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">As the largest US-based miner of rare earths, MP is a different way to play the trend of traditional oil combustion based engines to electrification and the EV supply chain. What we mean by this is often people today are investing in the consumer facing end of this trend (i.e. Tesla, GM, etc.) but this takes a few steps back on the supply chain and is a rare chance to offer an investment into the raw materials into this space. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #332f4f;">MP provides Tesla and other companies "electrifying" the world the materials needed to build their businesses! The thesis here is that if clean energy increases in demand, MP will be the one to supply it. So rather than pick the company who will either win the EV space, wind turbine, etc., this is a way to just participate in a general increase in demand across the sector!</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #06cbf8;"><strong>MP is in an interesting position because whether China or the US wins the EV war, this company will stand to benefit!</strong></span></h4>
