This type of investment factors in all of the conditions of the market and responds in real time to the overall sentiment. This type of investment is unlike anything we&rsquo;ve ever covered before and we&rsquo;re extremely excited to break down one of the coolest strategies we&rsquo;ve ever come across.&quot;]]],[1,&quot;p&quot;,[[0,[0],1,&quot;Pre-Read Context: &quot;],[0,[],0,&quot;While everyone is always asking us, &ldquo;Moby, what investments have the highest upside and what should I invest in?&rdquo; - we always respond with two answers. They are 1) what type of upside are you seeking and 2) How much risk are you willing to tolerate as part of achieving that upside? While many of you reading this realize that more risk = more potential reward, you need to realize that the inverse often happens as well.&quot;]]],[1,&quot;p&quot;,[[0,[],0,&quot;Let&rsquo;s take an example of a speculative investment like crypto. Over the years bitcoin has seen a tidal wave of pricing. Rewind to late 2017 and the price was hitting close to $18,000 and investors were thrilled. Fast forward to mid-2020 and the prices were slumping under $10,000 per coin. As 2020 progressed into mid-2021 (the time this analysis was written), we&rsquo;ve seen the price climb to over $60,000 a coin to now around $35,000 a coin. A quick example like this shows the reward some people have claimed while taking on significant risk. &quot;]]],[1,&quot;p&quot;,[[0,[],0,&quot;Some people can stomach this volatility while others cannot. And one of the key criteria of choosing a certain investment like this is measured in relation to your expected returns and overall risk for those returns. In other words investors should be trying to maximize those returns measured in every incremental level of risk that you take for each return. If an investment is expected to have a return of 20% but a risk of 10 (often measured in standard deviations) while another is offering 18% returns with a risk of 2, rational investors should be choosing the latter as the 2% incremental return is clearly not worth the added risk. Quantifying this into a number is known as the Sharpe Ratio! This is the gold standard for many fund managers and portfolio managers across the globe and is often calculated at the portfolio level rather than the individual level.&quot;]]],[10,0],[1,&quot;p&quot;,[[0,[],0,&quot;Therefore these smart investors often try to diversify their portfolio in a way that minimizes the downside risk while still riding the bullish trends and looking for upside. The outcome of this often leads to these managers excluding certain types of investments if the upside of the investment isn" t="" worth="" the="" risk="" it="" adds="" to="" their="" overall=""

They are 1) what type of upside are you seeking and 2) How much risk are you willing to tolerate as part of achieving that upside? While many of you reading this realize that more risk = more potential reward, you need to realize that the inverse often happens as well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take an example of a speculative investment like crypto. Over the years bitcoin has seen a tidal wave of pricing. Rewind to late 2017 and the price was hitting close to $18,000 and investors were thrilled. Fast forward to mid-2020 and the prices were slumping under $10,000 per coin. As 2020 progressed into mid-2021 (the time this analysis was written), we&rsquo;ve seen the price climb to over $60,000 a coin to now around $35,000 a coin. A quick example like this shows the reward some people have claimed while taking on significant risk.</p>
<p>Some people can stomach this volatility while others cannot. And one of the key criteria of choosing a certain investment like this is measured in relation to your expected returns and overall risk for those returns. In other words investors should be trying to maximize those returns measured in every incremental level of risk that you take for each return. If an investment is expected to have a return of 20% but a risk of 10 (often measured in standard deviations) while another is offering 18% returns with a risk of 2, rational investors should be choosing the latter as the 2% incremental return is clearly not worth the added risk. Quantifying this into a number is known as the Sharpe Ratio! This is the gold standard for many fund managers and portfolio managers across the globe and is often calculated at the portfolio level rather than the individual level.</p>

<p>Therefore these smart investors often try to diversify their portfolio in a way that minimizes the downside risk while still riding the bullish trends and looking for upside. The outcome of this often leads to these managers excluding certain types of investments if the upside of the investment isn't worth the risk it adds to their overall portfolio. However, we've recently discovered a new type of ETF that helps investors achieve these types of goals and take the guesswork out of it. They're called Asymmetric <strong>(Ticker: ASPY) </strong>ETFs!</p>
<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>So what are they, how do they differ from the conventional ETFs, and who are they suitable for? Let's break it down below:</p>
<ul>
<li>So what are the ASYM ETFs? ASYM ETFs were created under the following notion. In the world of investing it is widely observed that stocks belonging to the same segment, industry or sector tend to behave similarly (their prices move in tandem, and their returns are closely correlated). Conversely there are other stocks that often trade in the opposite direction. This, in economics, is known as compliments and substitutes. Think of it with an oversimplified example below:</li>
<li>If hot dog sales are projected to skyrocket this summer due to an increase in summer BBQs, then one can predict that sales of buns and mustard/ketchup will do well as well. Conversely if hot dogs are the overwhelming choice of food this summer, one may assume that hamburger sales may dip as preferences move towards hot dogs instead. This oversimplified example shows how goods move in pairs. Relating this back to the stock market we see the same phenomenon with stocks in the same industry. For example if car sales are projected to do very well, then we can expect car manufacturers to reap the rewards. Conversely if clean energy is projected to do well, we can expect traditional energy (such as oil) to underperform.</li>
<li>These relationships are extremely important and are something that professional investors often pay attention to during their portfolio construction process. They end up trying to include multiple sectors, especially those which are weakly correlated or even negatively correlated! They do this because they want to mitigate any risks that are present in overly concentrated portfolios. For example if they owned all tech stocks and the nasdaq sold off, even if the stocks they held were strong, they&rsquo;d be susceptible to the macro forces. Therefore by implementing a system of diversification, portfolio managers can mitigate excess risk. In financial terms, this is known as &lsquo;eliminating unsystematic or diversifiable risk&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Now that you understand the power of diversification, you can truly appreciate what makes these ETFs so special! Asymmetric ETFs, takes this thought process but goes a step further. Not only do they diversify their investments into all of the 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500, but they also study the stock market trends very closely! They keep an eye on the price momentum and price volatility. Based on these two metrics, the Fund Managers classifies the market situation at any point of time into one of the 3 instances below. Using these instances, ASYM rotates their risk preferences in order to capitalize on the market&rsquo;s movements. In other words, they&rsquo;re not only diversifying your sector analysis, but they&rsquo;re diversifying your risk as well (in real time!) Tying this all together with the ratios discussed above, as well as the relationships between sectors, ASYM is keeping in mind excess returns relative to risk, and is making smart investments that further benefit the quantifiable section of your portfolio. Now that you understand what they are, let&rsquo;s break down how they&rsquo;re doing it:</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.moby.co/content/images/2021/07/Hot-Dog-Sales.png" width="551" height="214" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
<p>As mentioned above they break down the market situations into 3 different instances.</p>
<img src="https://www.moby.co/content/images/2021/07/ASYMmetric-Risk-Management-Technology--uses-proprietary-price-based-algorithms-to-dynamically-manage-net-exposure-in-three-market-risk-environments-Risk-Off-Market-prices-are-trending-down-and-have-high-price-volatil.png" width="551" height="255" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
<p><strong>1) The first instance is known as &ldquo;Risk-On&rdquo;:</strong> What does this mean? This means that the price momentum is on the upside, and the realized volatility is quite low. Price momentum on the upside means that prices are going up and are believed to continue to keep going up for the foreseeable future. Additionally realized volatility being low means that the upwards trajectory comes with little to no large downward spikes. All in all, ASYM and others view this as the perfect time to maximize overall returns! Therefore the fund managers at ASYM go long (i.e. initiate a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; position) in general, with some short positions (i.e. &lsquo;sell&rsquo; positions) in order to mitigate any downside risk. This creates an environment where they&rsquo;re hedging some downside risk, but have declared that they&rsquo;re investing in a favorable environment. Therefore at risk-on, they believe this is where they&rsquo;ll be able to capitalize on the most upside in regards to overall returns.</p>
<p><strong>2) The next instance is known as &ldquo;Risk-Elevated&rdquo;: </strong>In this phase ASYM has identified that general market prices are going down, but the overall volatility is still quite low. The managers believe that this is just a &lsquo;phase&rsquo;, and their approach shifts to simply protecting the capital (i.e. reducing the risk) without going for aggressive returns. They still believe they can achieve better than market returns but do not want to take on the general downside associated with the market. Doing this can also be achieved via a market neutral strategy. A market neutral strategy is when the long positions and the short positions nullify (cancel) each other&rsquo;s movements, resulting in overall aggregate risk elimination. In this example, a portfolio should have 0% return relative to the benchmark. Therefore if the S&amp;P 500 goes up or down 10% their portfolio should remain at zero. However in a market neutral portfolio, the portfolio managers often will pick stocks that they like to counter act the 0% balance. This is where the true stock picking nature of the manager really shines. In this example, the manager takes 0% of the market&rsquo;s movements and only the true stock&rsquo;s return (less any upside/downside associated with the movements of the S&amp;P 500) is shown. The reason this happens is because of the beta of the stock (also known as the expected measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market). For example if a stock has a beta of 1.2 and the S&amp;P 500 goes up 1%, the stock would be expected to go up 1.2%. In a market neutral strategy beta is completely eliminated and thus should not be affected by general movements of the stock market. This is an advanced investing strategy that funds often employ!</p>
<p><strong>3) The final instance is known as &ldquo;Risk-Off&rdquo;: </strong>This is the classic recession scenario where they believe stock prices are plunging and will continue to plunge to significant lows (with massive volatility)! In this scenario however, rather than being defensive, ASYM actually reaps returns from this situation by having a &lsquo;net short position&rsquo; (by holding more short positions than long). What this does is that as the stock prices stoop lower, the ETF makes greater profits!</p>
<p>The ETFs, therefore, follow a rules-based, quantitative long/short hedging strategy based on S&amp;P 500 stocks.</p>
<img src="https://www.moby.co/content/images/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-28-at-3.32.11-PM.png" width="550" height="268" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Key Takeaway: </strong></h2>
<p>The amazing thing about this ETF is that, as an investor, you&rsquo;re able to benefit from general market swings in either direction. And the best part about it, is that they do all the work for you. Using proprietary tools, ASYM is able to judge the swings of the market and therefore allocate your portfolio to benefit from up days and down days! This is truly unique, as an ETF investment vehicle, and is something we&rsquo;re loading up on in order to hedge our own risks! Looking across other types of ETFs we can confidently say that we&rsquo;ve yet to come across this and it does not exist elsewhere in the market!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How it works: </strong></h2>
<p>Too good to be true? Skeptical? Breaking it down further, this means that their investment approach is focused on several factors:</p>
<p><strong>1. Rules-Based:</strong> The managers depend on the above rules to make investment decisions, rather than simply going with their analysis or intuition. This makes the process completely unbiased. In this example the managers completely rely on the numbers and take the human component out of it. This may seem standard but it is far from so. Being rules based makes this easier to comprehend and implement.</p>
<p><strong>2. Quantitative:</strong> The investments are managed based on statistical and mathematical models, computerized systems and automated data analysis, to maximize the probability of profitable outcomes. This is where their proprietary tools shine. ASYM uses these tools and models to truly come up with some great algorithms to automate a lot of what humans usually do on the front end. This is largely <strong>THEIR BIGGEST DIFFERENTIATOR.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Based on S&amp;P 500:</strong> Lastly their investments are all relative to the S&amp;P 500 - which consists of the biggest, most stable and risk-resilient 500 stocks of the US stock market. Trying to outperform this benchmark is the gold standard for all investment managers. This gives us faith that the managers at ASYM are not betting your money on speculative businesses or high-risk companies but rather companies with track records and solid historical fundamentals.</p>
<p><strong>4. Technology:</strong> The Asymmetric ETFs are based on the AMC&rsquo;s proprietary Asymmetric Risk Management Technology. It is a critically acclaimed IP that proactively tracks the market to react quickly and optimize the risk-adjusted returns. With these ETFs, you get access to pretty sophisticated solutions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>So what&rsquo;s our take on it?:</strong></h2>
<p>We want to reiterate that every individual investor has different return expectations, risk appetite and time horizon&rsquo;s, based on which investments they believe should be made. Therefore the strategy followed by Asymmetric ETFs, relative to this, is that of keeping your capital protected at all costs, while benefiting from clear trends, during definitive phases of a stock market cycle. These ETFs will keep the risks as low as possible, and optimize the returns per each degree of risk (standard deviation). If you&rsquo;re trying to maximize your sharpe ratio (see above) and only take on investments where the risk return profile makes sense then this is an interesting way to do it. After spending much time analyzing this new investment vehicle, we give it our Moby stamp of approval. This is something we&rsquo;ll continue to monitor as time goes on.</p>
